There are 3 subdirectories: 'build_model', 'correlations',  and 'plots'. 'build_model' includes R scripts for the final predictive models and shell scripts for running them on slurm. 'correlations' includes scripts for determining the correlation coefficient between predictor variables. 'plots' includes scripts for creating some figures after the predictive models are finished.
