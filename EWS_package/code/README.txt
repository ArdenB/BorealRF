This directory includes 3 subdirectories: 'analysis', 'data_prep', and 'vi_calcs'. At times the split may seem a bit arbitrary, but in  general 'analysis' holds scripts that are applying some analysis to the data, including model building, correlation analysis and plots. 'data_prep' includes scripts that are used to prepare any datasets (except VIs) for use in the model. 'vi_calcs' includes scripts used for preparing VIs for use in the analysis.
