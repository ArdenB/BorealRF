README for 'database_consolidation' directory

A much more detailed description of what's going on here is included in this directory as the .txt file 'PSP_database_prep_procedures'. I wrote this file while I was using all these scripts so it should be more accurate than anything I can write now, over a year since the last time I used any of these. What I will note here is that each database comes from a different initial format, hence the individual 'check' files. I attempted to deal with mistakes in inventory or data input in each of these files (with the exception of Quebec, which has it's own script 'QCtree_error_correct' because trying to do it all at once was too much since it is such a huge database), however there may still be mistakes in my attempt to correct mistakes. Refer to the aforementioned .txt file for instructions on use.
